## 🎯 Next Recommended Tasks: Get project UI MVP ready.

**NOTE TO AI:** Tick checkboxes as soon as task has been implemented.

**General fixes**
- [x] Remove the page /wallet from the navigation. Won't be part of MVP.
- [x] Remove "Offline-first • Auto-sync when online" badge from home page.
- [x] Remove "Delete account" from /settings page.
- [x] Remove settings button from home page
- [x] Remove "Offline sync" from settings page.
- [x] Remove "display name" from settings page
- [x] Redirect users to settings page when they click on their user info on the nav bar.
- [x] Allow trip name to be edited inline (similar to editing a title of a PR in github)
- [ ] Fix sub menu navigation on mobile (i.e "Timeline", "Overview" and "Map" buttons should show in one row)

**Overview page changes (Gantt chart) /overview**
- [x] Remove logic for dragging/moving events in Gantt chart.
- [x] Change default zoom to "225%" (this will be the equivalent of the new 100% today). Increase size of day col on mobile too. Ideally the same size on desktop should correspond to the size on mobile (i.e if 225% equal to 200px this would be the size on both mobile and dekstop.)
- [x] Remove the "Day" / "Month" switch from Gantt chart. Default it to "Day" as it is today.
- [x] Move events of type "flight" and "hotels" collapsed by default. This should live somewhere in 
configuration (not the user configuration, but in the code configuration)
- [x] BUG: minimum size of events in Gantt chart is wrong. (Fixed: events now show actual duration, point events show as diamond markers, tooltip shows activities within 30min window)
- [x] Add vertical line on top of gantt chart following mouse X position across the days of the week and automatically show tooltip of whatever is under it.
- [x] It should be possible to zoom to less than 100%. (Now supports 50% to 300%)

**Planning tasks (output: plan doc)**
- [ ] Map page (idea: map view should also have a "play" button and speed controls and have some animations showing planned routes and all.)
- [x] Add support for dark mode. (Fixed: Created ThemeContext, toggle works and persists preference)
- [ ] Add "tasks" section to /trip pages. Vertically split on desktop, horizontally split on mobile. As example of tasks: book flights, book hotels.
- [ ] BUG: Need to click on close button twice on the activity panel for it to close. 
- [ ] New UI for planning trip: quiz instead of AI. Quiz questions generated by AI. A lot of quiz options let user type answer if they want to (similar to "other" checkbox)
- [ ] Reconsider adding activities inline as opposed to side panel.
